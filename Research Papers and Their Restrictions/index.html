				What is a research paper? What comes to our minds, when we hear the words “research” and “paper”? Normally the instant the teacher utters those words, we imagine ourselves spending hours and hours reviewing articles and books or surfing through the web hunting the thoughts and ideas of other people relevant to the given topic. Furthermore based on our secondary education, we were taught that these types of papers come with certain rules and restrictions. Back in high school, when writing a research paper, there was a structure to follow, words that can or cannot be used, topics or certain schools of thought that had to be avoided at all cost should you want a good grade. What are they and why do they exist?
			</p>
			<p>
				In high school, a research paper consists of more than three pages with at least five paragraphs and mostly importantly, it should contain a satisfactory amount of citations. The primary reason why such a method exists is due tradition. Personal experiences or words that represent the writer was such a taboo in high school that if they were ever used in a research paper, your grade on the paper would definitely drop by a letter grade. The most common word in that category is “I”. Back then we were all told that “I” should never be used in a research paper because of the nature of the paper. By definition, research paper are papers based on facts and figures and as such is presumably in conflict with “I” which represents a personal opinion. Offensive words like “sex”, “nigger” and more were also considered as unacceptable. This is due to the unwritten rule which has been created either by the teacher’s personal reasons or by surrounding social norms.

				In Mauritius, if you were to include a heavy reference or ideas in a research paper (sex, suicide, drugs), that paper might be instantly thrown to the bin or sent back to be rewritten. This is simply because either the teacher or the person grading it thinks that you are too young to be thinking or writing like that. With the freedom of expression that is being fought for today, this might seem hard to believe but I assure you that I speak from experience. As a matter of fact, my paper on teenage suicide and its causes was not only thrown to the bin but I was also sent to the principal’s offices because I was criticizing the education system and the teachers. Another problem that I encountered was that if you readily accepted a liberal and avant-garde school of thought regarding a social cause, it will lead you into trouble whereby your parents will be advised to take you to a psychologist for “problematic behaviour and thoughts”.

				However ever since I started college, change is constantly underway. One of the contributing factors to this change is the new audience. Professors are more flexible, society has moved forth, and instead of being repressed, you were encouraged to think outside the box and shout out any forbidden words. It merely means that new alternative ways are now available. For example the structure and length of the research paper has increased and no paper can be considered “inappropriate for your age”. It is now possible, depending on the topic, you are working on and its relevance, to personalize concepts. For example the research paper written by Carl Wilson is full of personal opinions and experiences. “Now, I realize this attitude and several to follow, probably makes me sound like a total asshole” and “My disdain persisted after I left the Celine group zero” .

				In this case, I can think of two reasons why his use of “I” and personal experience is acceptable. The very first reason would have to be the nature of his topic and the question he is explaining to the audience. The topic is about a singer and her songs and the question he is addressing is why some people (mainly critics) hate her music while the others like it. The topic itself is something that has no right or wrong answer. There isn't any kind of experiment that can be conducted to obtain a definite answer. As such a topic which is essentially heavily opinionated is allowed to contain personal ideas. The second reason would be its relevance. In Wilson’s paper, he is trying to provide a reason as to why he hates that type of music. “I hated disco and country as cleanly and purely as I now hate Celine Dion.” In a manner of speaking he is trying to make connections to the life of the readers. This way, it's easier to share his point of view. Basically personal experience can be used in any type of paper as long as they meet one of the reasons mentioned above.

				Take Dan Ariely’s paper in predictably irrational as an example. His paper is completely different from Wilson’s paper. It is on a topic that has to be supported by facts and figures so the use of “I” or personal experience should be avoided. Yet near the end of his paper, Ariely included “Barlow told me that I had to come to Burning Man with him, and that if I did, I would feel as if I had come home.” This small passage happens to be something thing that he experienced and which he felt relevant to this topic. Furthermore, I think that Ariely is taking his audience into account. The inclusion of this personal connection to the topic makes it more relatable to the reader.

				The structure, style, and the use of “I” or personal opinion are not the only ones that have changed in a college level research paper. Even plagiarism -the most important rule has also been slightly altered. Back in high school, the moment the teacher thinks that your work is not your own, your paper is instantly discarded and you might end up getting a detention. But that is not what has changed when you think about plagiarism in college. If caught plagiarizing, you will still be reported to the department and will automatically fail the class if it persists. What has changed is the severity of plagiarism. In James Porter’s paper on intertextuality, he speaks about how a creative writer is the creative borrower and even uses Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence as an example. “Their work suggests that Jefferson was by no means an original framer or a creative genius, as some like to suppose. Jefferson was a skilled writer to be sure but chiefly because he was an effective borrower of traces.” Furthermore Potter’s text slightly alters the way you look at plagiarism and how to write a research paper. As far as plagiarism is concerned, everyone will consciously or unconsciously copy someone else’s work and we only cite certain people in our papers because they are quite known in the community or the discourse you are in. A fine example would be when Melania Trump copied the Michelle Obama’s speech. It was immediately called out as the discourse was being addressed to the population which included a variety of people who were aware. The other point he raises in his paper is whether you are the author of the  paper you submit. The process often includes you writing a paper, then giving it to someone else for review and feedback. Afterwards, you edit that paper based on feedbacks and finally you might end up with something completely different from the original paper. Even Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence went through editing.  This process will help the paper attract more readers as nobody will read unappealing content.

				The alternative ways that are available as you start to address different audience do not change much. All they really do is provide more breathing room to the writer. The points raised by Porter make you think about the freedom given when writing a paper. Looking back, Ariely, Wilson and even Porter had to shape their papers in such a way that would attract people. Wilson included a lot of personal experiences to connect with the reader on a personal level, Ariely made the paper more lively by changing the way he starts the paper, and even examples like “take sex again. A guy … the lady is a tramp.” provided were all meant to help the reader to relate to his paper. But is it worth it? Obviously you will write a paper if it’s a must but would you do it for fun? Afterall, it is the audience that eventually shapes your paper and your writing style. Personally, I would not write a paper just for fun but all that said, a research paper can be exciting as long as the topic is fun and exciting.
