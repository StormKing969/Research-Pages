				What it means to be “fluent” in a language
			</b>

			<p>
				In today’s global world, the importance of english can neither be denied nor ignored since the English language is the most common language. The technological boom that has transformed the world into a global village, the language has seeped deeper into many sectors of our lives, ranging from personal to professional. Despite all this progress in our communication skills, there are still people who question the language and what it means to be fluent in it. But why?
			</p>
			<p>
				However, before I attempt to answer this question based on my own definition, I must first define ‘language’. The dictionary defines ‘language’ as a systematic means of communication by the use of sounds or conventional symbols. It is a code we all use to express ourselves and communicate to others. This system allows us to share ideas and feelings using sounds, gestures, signs or marks.
			</p>
			<p>
				As for my definition of fluency in a language, I understand it to be such when both parties communicating are able to understand and share ideas with little or no struggle. Now, based on my reading, there is no right or wrong way of speaking or writing in the English language or in any other language, for that matter. Unfortunately, this is an unnecessary cause of worry for many. 
			</p> 
 			<p>
 				Nonetheless, many attribute being ‘fluent in english’ to the use of proper grammar and sentence syntax. According to Jamila Lyiscott, this is just a myth to be busted - it is the situation you are currently in that defines the right way of speaking the language. The poem in “Three Ways Of Speaking English” demonstrates how the manner of speaking a language can yield different results. For example when you are at work or when you are talking to your professors, you include the use of “Sir” and other words similar to it. At that instance, professional or standard english is the proper way of showing your fluency in the language and similarly the use of colloquial english like “What's up bro...” is used with friends or family (imagine the awkwardness were the greetings swapped!)
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				Similarly in Amy Tan’s story, she speaks broken English with her mother and properly constructed sentences with her friends and colleagues. “It's because over the twenty years we've been together I've often used that same kind of English with him, and sometimes he even uses it with me. It has become our language of intimacy, a different sort of English that relates to family talk, the language I grew up with” 
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				The next wrongly labeled stereotype contributing to the misunderstanding and worry in what fluency is the use of proper English words. However, according to Anne Curzan, an English professor and a language historian, there is no such thing as a word that does not exist. In fact she say “If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means, it’s real” (16:11). This quote signifies that as long as a group of people is using a word, it is real. This can be seen when ‘Yoda’ became a noun in the Oxford dictionary in 2016. 
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				Dialect is another factor that mainstream uses to assess the fluency in a language. In this case, the fluency of the language is judged to the type of English or language you use. In “Mother Tongue” Amy Tan’s mother had to face many difficulties because she spoke broken English. One of them was in the hospital “She said she had spoken very good English, her best English, no mistakes. Still, she said, the hospital did not apologized when they said they had lost the CAT scan and she had come for nothing”. Quite similarly, In “Tame A Wild Tongue” people spoke a mixture or Spanish and English which is called Spanglish “Until I am free to write bilingually and to switch codes without having always to translate, while I still have to speak English or Spanish when I would rather speak Spanglish, and as long as I have to accommodate the English speakers rather than having them accommodate me, my tongue will be illegitimate.”
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				Ultimately, none can determine whether an individual person is fluent or not. All that matters is that both parties are able to communicate and share ideas. In Anne Curzan’s words:
				"it is rich and vibrant and filled with the creativity of the speakers who speak it."
 			</p>
 			<p>
 				In other words the language itself is continuously changing. But even if I do not agree, it is also understandable why people are teaching students to write and to speak in the manner that they call Standard English or Language. The reasons I can find for these restrictions is to facilitate the task of teachers and to ensure that we all have a universal medium of communication. Afteral,l if we all had a unique way of speaking, it would be impossible to talk effectively.
