				Random public shootings, mostly school shootings, have increased in the past years. When these types of tragedies happen, they receive a lot of attention from society through mass media. The news follows these incidents for weeks discussing the shooter’s motives and life. While the motives may vary from shooter to shooter, the most common one would be their desire for fame and attention. However, the major issue is the nonstop media coverage that each shooter receives depending on the number of victims who could encourage “copycat” shooters to do the same to fulfill their desire. So why does the media keep getting involved? Were they always like that?
			</p>
			<p>
				Research into mass shootings ended up pointing to four probable contributing factors: mental illness, culture of violence followed by the access to weapons and finally social or family distress. Both similarities and differences can be observed among the perpetrators and like Manson said in his article “How We All Miss the Point on School Shooting” most of them had no history of criminal behavior before the attack but traces could be found through their interest in violence in video game, movies, books or other form of media. The media fame acquired through a shooting may not be enough to start one. However our culture services as a general background for school shooting incidents, even if no connection has been established. As such there is a connection between mass media and social problems. Social scientists have examined the media framing of school shooting incidents and concluded that media coverage plays a fundamental role in the public opinion of school shootings as a social problem. The media, considered the fourth pillar of society is suddenly contributing to its crumble.

				Well, to be precise nothing has changed. The media is doing the same thing as what they were doing since the very start… and that is the problem. To start with, the media exists solely to transmit message over long distances and in exchange they make money. Ever since the new form of income called “advertisement”, their goals have slightly changed. The media outlet airs an ad in between their broadcast since it’s the only way to be sure that people are watching the advertisement. The more ad the media broadcasts, the more money they make so to achieve that they must make interesting and long episodes. As such, they are more focused on having a viewer glued in front of his television rather than broadcasting the actual information. According to the article Media Contagion is a factor in Mass Shootings, “scary homicides are the number one rating and advertising boosters” (para. 3). This is quite true due to our human nature –we are all attracted to violence. We definitely don't enjoy it inflicted upon us but, it gives us a sense of being human, discussing about it as a third party (a spectator). Unfortunately, that’s not all that the media usually considers when the decide to air a mass shooting. According to Manson, the FBI said that mass shootings (a shootings event that kills at least four people) occur on average every two weeks in the United States (3). So, if that’s the case the media will be overwhelmed by the sheer number of killings so the media came up with certain criteria that would only pick the shootings that will attract the most amount of views. According to Manson, some of them are those that “occur in everyday public location which is supposed to be safe, victims are targeted and killed at random, victims are innocent bystanders and often children, killer leaves behind large amounts of material about themselves for the media to share, the perpetrator and victims are generally upper-middle class white and privileged” (3). In my opinion the reason why Manson mentions “white and privileged” is because everyone is somewhat racist at a subconscious level and the other one would be the factor that privileged meaning they have everything one needs to live a good life and as such their actions seems irrational. That would be a great mystery to solve on live television. 
			</p>

				The reasons why they broadcast such events aren’t the only thing that’s unfortunate. What they do during them are even more disappointing. It’s like after seeing and reporting so many tragedies, the reports and broadcaster have gotten used to it and can no longer show any true emotions. King explains in his article “Guns -- The Shake”, what the media do when a shooting occurs staring from the fifth steps in a musical fashion. Reading that was like getting slapped with the hand of reality. But the most interesting ones are Eighth, Tenth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Fourteenth and Sixteenth. On the Eighth, King talks about how the killer is incorrectly identified then in Tenth the killer is properly identified. Now I believe that it’s not an innocent mistake of mistaken identity but a cunning way to add a dramatic touch to an intense moment. For example, the reporter would go on and say something like “The suspect has been identified as a boy mid-sixteens (Pauses of a second while holding his ear piece) Wait!! (Looks at the floor) No!! (Looks at the floor and turns his head to the side) It’s now being said that it’s a thirteen years old boy” This way he can captivate the attention of the viewer at an early stage. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Afterward in Twelfth, Kings speaks about the dumb questions the reporters are being paid to ask the eye witness. It’s already obvious enough to conclude that those who were present are not happy and are feeling distressed. But in order to keep the viewer stuck to the television, they must see the tears of the eye witness, their inability to articulate words properly, the horror on their faces, the desperation of the people whose loved ones are still inside the chaos. All of that combined would make quite an interesting story. After that the deal is sealed, the reporter has successfully attracted the maximum, amount of viewer. And we, the viewer cannot stop ourselves from no knowing the ending of this tragedy just like we can’t help ourselves from no knowing the ending of a good movie. Now, no matter how many advertisements are passed in between, we won’t turn off the television. This way we cease to be a third party (spectator) and became part of the problem. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Then comes Fourteenth, one of the biggest problem of the media. On the fourteenth step, recaps of previous shootings begin and is compared to the current one. This is how we, the audience becomes part of the problem. Like the Media who spends time talking about the shooters on air, we keep retelling the incident and the name of the shooter to those we know. This process is what make the perpetrator, an everlasting figure and their victims, an unfortunate event of the “wrong place wrong time”. After all, if we ever to ask someone who Jack The Ripper was, they would instantly tell us that he was a serial killer that killer a lot of prostitute or Adam Lanza, another mass murderer who went on a killing streak but if we ask them about their victims, not a single piece of information comes to our mind. And finally, on the Sixteenth step in King’s novel, the media continues to speak about the shooting for a period of seventy-two hours which is usually the amount of period that such a tragedy can attract people to watch afterwards in becomes old news. The sad part in this step is the fact that the media will now interview the family members of the victims and the shooter claiming that they are trying to find the reason behind this incident. They even go to the funerals if the number of casualties are  high. That goes on to say that the victims will not be forgotten but the truth is that only those that have been affected directly by this incident will remember their names and as for the shooter, his or her name will be forever engraved on the internet due to the amount of death. Later, the crimes might be ranked in a book or have a website dedicated to each tragedy. But what’s even worse is that somewhere in the world there is someone willing to buy a personal item of those killers for a price for a twisted reason.

				Unfortunately, that doesn’t stop there. Their involvement under the false pretext of wanting to share the news with the public is also inspiring others to commits these heinous acts. And according to Tower’s research this unwanted effect is called the copycat effect. From the article “Here’s What We Know About the Contagion Effect of Mass Shooting” a statistical analysis of 176 mass shooting events in the U.S. was conducted. There they concluded that mass shootings were significantly more likely to occur if another shooting that occurred 13 days prior to the current one received national media coverage. Also, research conducted by Jennifer Johnston, Ph.D. and Andrew Joy, BS from Western New Mexico University suggested that most the mass shooters researched and were inspired by past shootings (5). Furthermore, a famous study conducted in the early 1960s found that children learn social behaviors by watching the behavior of other and they were particularly likely to act with aggression when they saw an adult being rewarded for behaving aggressively. As such the national media attention that the acts of violence receive from the country may be view as a reward thus encouraging them to commit similar crimes. Richard Amaral, a counseling psychologist in Ontario wrote in a blog post that by glorifying and sensationalizing those who commit horrific crimes, we are only adding the likelihood that similar crimes will be carried out by those craving the same type of attention. And that’s what the media is doing under the pretext of sharing information. Jack Levin, a criminologist at Northeastern University takes it a step further by saying that the killings stopped abruptly after the terror attack of September 11, 2001 and did not resume for several months (Para. 13). According to him, the reason behind it was that the media was focused on a story far bigger than any shootings and in a way, we ended up by robbing the copycat phenomenon that Tower’s mentioned of its inspiration. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Over time, many have requested the media to change their ways of sharing the news. Many have ever suggested some solution to this problem. Harris Stratyner, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine said “We should not give out the names, we should not show bloody scenes. We should stop turning these people (the perpetrators) into legends, because that’s what inspires copycat crimes”. In other words, we should simply remember the victims instead of the criminals. And prevent the media from ranking the crimes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Unfortunately, all we can do right now is ask the media leaders to do so because as far as the justice sector is concerned, no laws have been broken. It’s about time that the media realizes the fact that they are not just reporting these crimes and that depending on how they report them, they are accomplices. At the end of the day, the problem lies in the way the news is being reported. The emphasis is rarely on the victims but mostly on the killer and we make celebrities/legends out of monsters. Doing so, might not stop the killings but it will certainly decrease in number.
