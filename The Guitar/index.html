				"Not again. Not again" I remember spitting out as I angrily threw the phone on the bed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I knew I was no Keith Richards but there should be a decent amount of talent in that recording. I had been practicing This Is War by 30 Seconds To Mars for 2 weeks and I could only cringe with each note that resounded over the phone recorder. Surprisingly, anger only fueled my determination to persevere until I was satisfied with what I heard. I have given up so much and breezed by multiple projects in the past that I wanted this to be different.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I want to change. I have to!"
			</p>
			<p>
				I vividly recall that moment when I suddenly decided that I had had enough of making excuses. Looking back, failure after failure and my own laissez-faire attitude must have woven a tapestry of resilience for such a thought to inhibit me. It struck a chord, I must say!
			</p>
			<p>
				"Epic music in the background would have generated an oscar worthy scene," I smirked.
			</p>

				I can't remember when my love affair with my guitar began. It must have been after the first few lessons in seventh grade when I soon realized that playing the guitar completed me. In my broken, mundane life, it became my companion, the only constant in the midst of change as I kept moving - countries, houses then schools, learning new languages, maneuvering through my parents' divorce and financial troubles. It was always in a corner of the room, collecting memories. Unbeknownst, the guitar became synonym to the comfort I sought when the reality of my broken family sunk in. It was the friend when my friends turned their back on me, the warmth when cold failure bruised me, my pride that I could show off to my sister and brother.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I should be proud of this," I mumbled
			</p>
			<p>
				The imperfections were there - I could hear them, but the melody I heard this time sounded different. Every note pierced the truth in, leaving me gasping for air. I finally understood why moving to the US was different and why this past year saw my life come to a stand still. It was my aha moment! I had finally become the narrator of my own story the moment the winter wind slapped me as the exit doors of the Boston Airport opened. It was the beginning of a long journey.

				I will stumble to a cliff once in awhile that will require me to jump. When that situation arises, my guitar will be my parachute because I am not playing for anyone, and my talent is not stellar but it's different from anyone else's â€“ it's mine. Indeed, there are no words to describe how proud I am of my ability that has influenced much of who I am today. The fight to perfect a piece has allowed me to develop an aggressive ambition that I know will not allow me to give up. I am determined to use that passion to make a difference in people's lives around me. Music has so much power within its core - not reserved for the talented or the famous. The quiet musicians have an even louder impact. I want to give back to the community, show people how to find an escape and a strength in their imperfect music. As the second in my family to go to college, my younger brother will be the first person who will see me as an inspiration. How can I pause before beginning?
			</p>
			<p>
				I smiled as I realized that with every strum of the string, my guitar would fan the flames of my budding talent. It will be my companion in college, seeing the start of a great adventure and encouraging me when the melody of my life becomes mundane so that I can rewrite the chords, change the rhythm, arrange the tune and embellish the song.
